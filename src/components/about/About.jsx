      <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hello! I'm a passionate full-stack developer in the making, 
                currently transitioning from a successful career in project management 
                and business development to the dynamic world of tech. 
                This exciting mid-life career change reflects my love for continuous learning 
                and growth.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Family Life</h3>
            <p>
                When I'm not coding or learning about new technologies, 
                I cherish spending time with my wife and two wonderful daughters and our dog.
                Family is my cornerstone, and it fuels my dedication and drive.
            </p>

            <h3>Interests</h3>
            <p>
                Outside of my professional life, I'm an avid football fan, 
                a skilled cook who loves to experiment with new recipes, 
                and a golf enthusiast. Music is also a big part of my life, 
                and I enjoy both listening to and playing it.
            </p>
